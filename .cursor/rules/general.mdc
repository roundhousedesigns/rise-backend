# Overview

This project is a WordPress website with an embedded React application at the '/directory' endpoint. The React app is a user directory and jobs board, which allows users to fill out their profiles and relevant work experience so that they might appear in another user's candidate searches.

# Tech Stack

We use Docker Compose to host this site. The stack consists of WordPress (php-fpm), Apache, WP-CLI, MariaDB, and Redis containers.

Core site components:
  - WordPress
  - PHP 8.2+
  - WP GraphQL (https://www.wpgraphql.com/)
  - React 19

We're using the https://wordpress.org/plugins/reactpress/ plugin to facilitate hosting the React app inside the WordPress frontend structure.

# Project Structure

The WordPress backend is in the `wp-content/` directory. The majority of our site's functionality is in the `rise` mu-plugin.

The React frontend is in the `wp-content/reactpress/apps/rise-frontend` directory.
